			Aspire After Nostalgia

			Pokemon Blue is one of the best consumer media products I’ve ever seen. Probably <i>the</i> best. When the game was released in 1998, brand-new copies sold for $29.95. Today, used copies are selling for $39.99. Twenty years later, that's what product market fit looks like!

		<p>
			So, used versions sell for 33% more today than new ones did in 1998. That’s 1.5% compounded annual price appreciation for 20 years. Crazy! These used copies will be 21 years old this September!
		</p>
		<p>
			Inflation has been ~2% annually since 1998. So, these games haven’t been a perfect store of value. But I find it incredible that they’ve held their value at all. After all, these titles have been available on emulators for at least a decade and via 3DS download for a few years. And the actual components in the games themselves have been decaying for two decades. So why have prices risen?
		</p>
		<p>
			Accessibility helps the physical games keep their value. Not everybody is going to shell out $100+ for a 3DS to play this on. And not everybody knows how to run an emulator successfully. Plenty more probably still have Game Boys laying around. But I think there’s another factor at work here: nostalgia. A desire to consume a familiar experience in its original form.
		</p>
		<p>
			And that original form is great. GameBoy buttons have a wonderful tactility to them. The songs — and their shared four notes — are wonderfully repetitive. Today’s 4K TVs make me laugh every time I think of Blue’s 8-bit graphics. The storyline is challenging, yet rewarding.
		</p>
		<p>
			This makes me wonder: what will be 2039’s Pokemon Blue equivalent? And, more importantly… why will those things hold nostalgic value? Will the qualities of a nostalgic consumer experience remain durable? Or will they shift over time? As we create and discover wildly new mediums, will the core experiences themselves change as well?

		<p>
			So, consumer companies: how will you become the next Pokemon Blue? What will you do to ensure that your relationship with customers lasts for the next 20 years and beyond? [2]

			[1] For instance, as data becomes portable cross-platform and more independent developers emerge, will we crave types of games more than games themselves? (Similar to craving ‘80s rock hits’ vs. one specific song.)
		</p>
		<p>
			[2] Aspiring after nostalgia is probably a good heuristic for building an enduring consumer brand. Why will <i>yours</i> be the experience that consumers wistfully recall decades from now?
