				<h1>
					Is Finance No Longer in Charge?
				</h1>
				<p>
					February 27th, 2019
				</p>
				<p>
					I started writing this back in November when Marginal Revolution first shared the following post: <a
						href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/11/biology-now-charge.html" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Is biology now in charge?</a> The original essay, written by Laura Deming, is linked
					<a href="https://ldeming.posthaven.com/sequencing-is-the-new-microscope" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Here’s a key excerpt:
				</p>
				<p>
				<blockquote>
					<i>
						“One of my biggest personal fears is working in the wrong field to achieve the goal I care about. If you were
						around pre-1900s, and wanted to contribute to biology, you should have been a physicist (Robert Hooke, a
						physicist discovers the first cell, making a better microscope is a major driver of progress). In which field
						should you work to maximize progress in biology today?”
					</i>
				</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
					As Laura elaborates, in the first half of the 20th century, most advances in Biology actually came from the field
					of Physics – not Biology itself. However, at the century’s halfway point – around the 1950s – this flipped: most
					advances within Biology came from the field of Biology itself. The field became, in Laura’s words,
					“self-reinforcing.”
				</p>
				<p>
					I would argue that we are witnessing the inverse in financial services today. While finance once drew its
					innovations from itself, it is now increasingly drawing its innovations from the world of engineering.
				</p>
				<p>
					No technology was required to create the leveraged buyout; its creation can be attributed to a group of
					enterprising financiers and particularly adventurous lenders. Asset-backed securities? Similar story. Sure,
					technology can help to evaluate mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed products en masse. But no
					technology was required to create them in the first place. They’re paper contracts. Same with derivatives
					contracts, which trade in large volumes near-automatically today, but existed solely on paper at first.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finance today tells a different story. if you are a consumer of financial products, as we all are, this change is
					a welcome and exciting one.
				</p>
				<p>
					The financial services industry, after all, relies on fee-based revenues. Banks predominantly make money by
					borrowing capital at a low rate (deposits) and then lending it out at a high rate (loans). This has historically
					been a great business — one with a negligible cost of goods sold. [1]
				</p>
				<p>
					However, in the contemporary world of fees, we’re (fortunately!) witnessing a race to the bottom. Online banking
					and its related features have become ubiquitous. Now, companies are forced to compete on financial merit. How? By
					shaving off back-office costs required to maintain accounts. How? Technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here’s a great example:
				</p>
				<p>
					If you hold a savings account with Bank of America and you are lucky enough to qualify for their “Platinum Honors
					Tier,” your patronage will kindly be rewarded with 0.06% annual interest on your balance. However, if you bank
					with Goldman Sachs’s Marcus, you will earn 2.25% annual interest. You will earn 38x more with Marcus. Would you be
					content with paying 38x more for anything else in your life?
				</p>
				<p>
					Goldman and BoA obviously have different objectives here. Savings accounts are a money-maker for BoA, while
					Goldman is clearly hoping to draw customers to their newly-formed consumer bank, Marcus. (I’m very excited about
					Marcus. [2] I may elaborate on the reasons for why in a future post).
				</p>
				<p>
					Marcus had the luxury of starting from scratch. With no technical debt to be paid off at inception, it could build
					best-in-class infrastructure to support a 21st century digital bank. Goldman’s Marcus made fulfillment costs
					matter in consumer banking for the first time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nobody has really cared about this in finance until now. Consider, briefly, the finance profit equation: (money we
					make from fees) - (what we spend to maintain and create accounts) = profits.
				</p>
				<p>
					Until now, attention has only been paid to increasing fees. It’s no well-kept secret among financial services
					vendors, after all, that willingness to pay is never a concern. For enterprise software companies selling to
					banks, the front-of-mind question to expect is not “how much?” but “does it actually work?”
				</p>
				<p>
					Again, until now. Now that the fee war is on, profits will only go up if fees are cut down.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fred Wilson shared <a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/chart-of-the-day-or-century-2/" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">this chart</a> on his blog in November. It’s been circulated by other investors as
					well.
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="../images/consumer-price-changes-aei.jpg" loading="lazy"
						alt="Chart from AEI comparing the changes in price of selected US consumer goods and services to the change in wages, from January 1998 to June 2019.">
				</p>
				<p>
					I don’t think that we have exhausted all finance-driven financial innovations. I just think that most of the
					low-hanging fruit have been picked. It is time to turn our attention to financial infrastructure, not financial
					products. This requires engineering.
				</p>
				<p>
					As was recently shared on Fred Wilson’s blog, consumer surplus within financial services has not materially
					increased in the past century. To kick-start meaningful change, we need engineering talent to improve financial
					infrastructure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Robinhood is a great, specific example of a company fueling this trend. In October, Robinhood announced <a
						href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2018/10/9/introducing-clearing-by-robinhood" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Clearing by Robinhood</a>, its own, built-from-scratch clearing system. According to
					Robinhood, this is the first system of its kind to be built from scratch since Vanguard did so in 2008. Robinhood
					claims it will be able to reduce or eliminate fees, improve customer service (by increasing the speed with which
					CS reps can access data), and support new, future product offerings. All of these changes save Robinhood customers
					money.
				</p>
				<p>
					Take <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/What-is-a-bank-reversal-FAQ1120" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">bank reversal fees</a>, for instance:
				</p>
				<p>
					Before, bank reversal fees were $30, but once you’re on the new system, the fee will only be $9.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, consumers rarely pay bank reversal fees, so perhaps this isn’t the best example. But nevertheless, the fact
					remains that this represents a 3.3x reduction of a consumer’s fee load for bank reversal charges – all for two
					years’ worth of engineering work. Nice job, Robinhood.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is encouraging, as the amount of money spent on financial fees and commissions has been climbing at an
					alarming rate for decades. On a per capita basis, this number has more than doubled since 1998. Shouldn’t
					technology reduce fees… not create more?
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, Robinhood and other engineering-first finance companies will make that happen. Finance is no longer in
					charge.
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					[1] In this case, I think of COGS as fulfillment costs. What is the marginal labor (Analysts) or technology
					(servers; API calls) cost of creating a loan or opening an account?
				</p>
				<p>
					[2] Goldman recently moved its private wealth management business under the ‘Marcus’ umbrella. This is huge,
					exciting, news. I see this as a move down-market. Goldman PWM products were previously accessible only to the
					fabulously wealthy (I believe only to the upper end of HNW but don’t quote me on that). Now, I imagine they will
					roll out some interesting PWM offerings for the mainstream market (and, yes, these fees will probably be high.
					Stick to Vanguard).

					One would hope that these had gone down over the previous two decades. Particularly so given how many advances
					have been made in enterprise technology. But, this has unfortunately not been the case.
