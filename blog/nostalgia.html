					Aspire After Nostalgia
				</h1>
				<p>
					May 12th, 2019
				</p>
				<p>
					Pokemon Blue is one of the best consumer media products I’ve ever seen. Probably <i>the</i> best. When the game
					was released in 1998, brand-new copies sold for $29.95. Today, used copies are selling for $39.99. Twenty years
					later, that's what product market fit looks like!
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="../images/gameboy-pokemon-used.jpeg" alt="Used copies of Pokemon GameBoy games retailing for $39.99.">
				<p>
					So, used versions sell for 33% more today than new ones did in 1998. That’s 1.5% compounded annual price
					appreciation for 20 years. Crazy! These used copies will be 21 years old this September!
				</p>
				<p>
					Inflation has been ~2% annually since 1998. So, these games haven’t been a perfect store of value. But I
					find it incredible that they’ve held any value at all. After all, these titles have been available on
					emulators for at least a decade and via 3DS download for a few years. And the actual components in the games
					themselves have been decaying for two decades. So why have prices risen?
				</p>
				<p>
					Accessibility helps the physical games keep their value. Not everybody is going to shell out $100+ for a 3DS
					to play this on. And not everybody knows how to run an emulator successfully. Plenty more probably still
					have Game Boys laying around. But I think there’s another factor at work here: nostalgia. A desire to
					consume a familiar experience in its original form.
				</p>
				<p>
					And that original form is great. GameBoy buttons have a wonderful tactility to them. The songs — and their
					shared four notes — are wonderfully repetitive. Today’s 4K TVs make me laugh every time I think of Blue’s
					8-bit graphics. The storyline is challenging, yet rewarding.
				</p>
				<p>
					This makes me wonder: what will be 2039’s Pokemon Blue equivalent? And, more importantly… why will those
					things hold nostalgic value? Will the qualities of a nostalgic consumer experience remain durable? Or will
					they shift over time? As we create and discover wildly new mediums, will the core experiences themselves
					change as well? [1]
				</p>
				<p>
					So, consumer companies: how will you become the next Pokemon Blue? What will you do to ensure that your
					relationship with customers lasts for the next 20 years and beyond? [2]
				</p>
				<p>
					---
				</p>
				<p>
					[1] For instance, as data becomes portable cross-platform and more independent developers emerge, will we
					crave types of games more than games themselves? (Similar to craving ‘80s rock hits’ vs. one specific song.)
				</p>
				<p>
					[2] Aspiring after nostalgia is probably a good heuristic for building an enduring consumer brand. Why will
					<i>yours</i> be the experience that consumers wistfully recall decades from now?
